My name is Gustaf Olsson and I am currently working at the Linnaeus University in Kalmar, Sweden as a postdoc. My path of education has been nothing but straight, starting out in humanitarian sciences, jumping on to an engineering program, switching to an educational program in biomedical chemistry, followed by a PhD working with molecular modelling and computational chemistry studying polymeric materials, liquid mixtures and synthetic affinity systems. This has produced both a MSc and a PhD chemistry/computational chemistry.

I have also been fortunate to be able to teach a lot in my career, both entry level and higher level students on both bachelor and MSc levels. In addition to teaching and research I have, of course, also been taking some classes myself, learning some programming (mostly python) as well as informatics, bioinformatics and pharmaceutical bioinformatics.
