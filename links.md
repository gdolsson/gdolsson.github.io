* [AMBER](https://ambermd.org/)  
The \"Assisted Model Building with Energy Refinement\" (AMBER) homepage where you can find the software, tutorials and information.

* [AMBER-Hub](https://amberhub.chpc.utah.edu/)  
The AMBER-Hub page seems to be a nice collection of things related to suing AMBER and CPPTRAJ. You can find a lot of nice tips and solutions for solving problems and nicely presented tutorials. A nice addition to the manual and the official tutorials.

* [CHARMM-GUI](http://www.charmm-gui.org)  
A recurring mention when discussing building membrane systems and other more complicated systems. The title of the page tells the visitor that this is an \"Efective Simulation Input Generator and More\". I normally use [packmol](http://m3g.iqm.unicamp.br/packmol/home.shtml) for generating input files for simulations though this is a good alternative when/if facing problems constructing the system you want.

* [MIP-oriented Molecular Modelling](https://mipmolmodel.wordpress.com/)
A basic site thrown together for a workshop hosted at the Linnaeus University in Kalmar, Sweden.

* [PACKMOL](http://m3g.iqm.unicamp.br/packmol/home.shtml)  
As stated on top of the page, \"Initial configurations for Molecular Dynamics Simulations by packing optimization\". This is a classic regarding input preparation for MD simulations. Nowadays, a working installation of packmol is even bundled together with the Amber/AMberTools software package.

* [SLTCAP Calculator](https://www.phys.ksu.edu/personal/schmit/SLTCAP/SLTCAP.html)  
A nice resource to calculate the number of ions needed for MD simulations with a nice web-interface.
