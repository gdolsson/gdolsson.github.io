As I keep working on things I keep "finding" random shortcuts, in particular for excel. I thought that instead of pulling up google every time I need one I could put them here.

## Excel
[Source for some shortcuts](https://exceljet.net/keyboard-shortcuts)

`option + left/right arrow`  
Move between sheets in excel

`control + ยง`  
Find and replace

## macOS
`option + command + c`  
"Capitalize word" under cursor
