As I keep working on things I keep "finding" random shortcuts, in particular for excel. I thought that instead of pulling up google every time I need one I could put them here.

## Excel
[Source for some shortcuts](https://exceljet.net/keyboard-shortcuts)

`option + left/right arrow`  
Move between sheets in excel

`control + ยง`  
Find and replace

## PowerPoint
`fm + left/right`
First/Last slide in presentation
`b`
"Black-n-back", blackout screen and then revert

## macOS
`option + command + c`  
"Capitalize word" under cursor, press repeatedly to cycle

## VisualStudio Code
`command + k` and then `o`
"Open tab in new window"
