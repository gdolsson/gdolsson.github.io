From the author of "On Task" (David Badre), nature published a guest post on solving hard problems from a [neuroscience point of view](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00606-x).

In short, make sure you have reserved adequate time and space between tasks. There must be space in your everyday schedule to work on problems. Large blocks of time needs to be set aside to work on problems. Switching between tasks should be avoided as this causes a need for a mental reset. Distractions as well as multitasking should be avoided for the same reason. Consistency is important, the reserved time should be utilised for working on problems regardless of progress. Reviewing ones work is a perfectly fine activity for the reserved time. Making progress takes time and not giving up or loosing focus is important, even if it seems that progress is slow. Reconceptualize, take regular breaks and interact with other, all good habits when working on hard problems.

These seem like valid suggestions, question is how time management ideas fit into researched oriented operations on a broader scale.
