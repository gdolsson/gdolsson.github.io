Sometimes there is a need to enumerate subdomains, potentially to find "dead" sites or you forgot the correct adress. This is just some of the available tools for the task, at some point in time I might add some more information regarding the domains in question.

- [SSLScan](https://github.com/rbsec/sslscan/) available as a `brew install sslscan` on macOS, CLI tool
- [DNS Dumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com/) DNS recon & research, find & lookup dns records
