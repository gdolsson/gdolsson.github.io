Today I read about "[FragAttacks](https://www.fragattacks.com/)" where the name [Mathy Vanhoef](https://www.mathyvanhoef.com/) rang a bell. Turns out the Mathy had also been involved in [KRACK](https://www.krackattacks.com/) and [Dragonblood](https://wpa3.mathyvanhoef.com/) attacks as well. This is a very busy reasearcher and has found some really interresting problems with wireless commmunication.

Just wanted to put this up here with some links for future reading.
