[The universe as balls and springs: molecular dynamics in Python" - Lily Wang (PyCon AU 2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5umNQDqfqQ)

Really interesting presentation regarding performing simulations using python and including [nglview](http://nglviewer.org/nglview/latest/) library in [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/).
