This was news to me, though you can apparently create links to important settings by making folders with special names on windows.

So, in Windows 11, to enable "god mode"

1. Right-clock on desktop
2. Select "New" and "Folder"
3. Right-clock the folder (F2)
4. Rename the folder to: 
   - GodMode.{ED7BA470-8E54-465E-825C-99712043E01C} 
5. Press enter
6. Open the folde

There are, aparently, numerous of these "shortcuts" you can create:
- Adminimstrative Tools - {D20EA4E1-3957-11d2-A40B-0C5020524153}
- Network - {F02C1A0D-BE21-4350-88B0-7367FC96EF3C}
- Bluetooth - {28803F59-3A75-4058-995F-4EE5503B023C}
- Mouse properties - {6C8EEC18-8D75-41B2-A177-8831D59D2D50}
- Personalization - {ED834ED6-4B5A-4bfe-8F11-A626DCB6A921}
- Troubleshooting - {C58C4893-3BE0-4B45-ABB5-A63E4B8C8651}

Good to know for future reference.
