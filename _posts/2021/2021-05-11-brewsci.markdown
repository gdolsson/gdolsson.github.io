Sometimes you find additional hidden gems, it seems that there is a "[tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps)" within homebrew which allows installing additional packages not listed in the general installation, [Brewsci/bio](https://github.com/brewsci/homebrew-bio).

```
brew tap brewsci/bio
brew install FORMULA
```
or
```
brew install brewsci/bio/FORMULA
```
Where formula is, amongst others, the open source version of [pymol](https://github.com/schrodinger/pymol-open-source)
