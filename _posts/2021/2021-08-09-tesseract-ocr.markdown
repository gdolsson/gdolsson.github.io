[Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr) is a free and open source OCR software. A "[tutorial](https://guides.nyu.edu/c.php?g=884390&p=6355032)" of sorts. This is also available as a `brew install tesseract` and then `tesseract image-input.png output-filename -l eng pdf` or switch pdf to txt instead to get plain text output.
