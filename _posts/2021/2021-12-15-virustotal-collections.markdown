TL:DR from [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com): Threat researchers use Pastebin and similar sites to share sets of IoCs among themselves. We believe there is a more actionable and contextualized way to perform this task, enter [VirusTotal Collections](https://blog.virustotal.com/2021/11/introducing-virustotal-collections.html). Help us shape the future of IoC collections with the whatâ€™s next form.

Something like AlienVaultOTX and other IoC sharing services.
