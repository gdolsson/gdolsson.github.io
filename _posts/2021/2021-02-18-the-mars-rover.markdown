As far as I understand, today on the 18th of March 2020, the NASA Mars rover will land on Mars.

If the time conversion has worked, the rover will touch down around 22:00 (CET).

The event will be live-streamed through the [NASAS website](https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive) or their [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm0b_ijaYMQ). The stream is scheduled to start around 18:30 (CET) according to the program on the website.
