Cron can be used to \"automate\" and/or schedule tasks though is not always as user friendly and flexible as one could hope. As complement, [at](https://opensource.com/article/21/8/linux-at-command), [systemd](https://opensource.com/article/20/7/systemd-timers) and [anacron](https://opensource.com/article/21/2/linux-automation) is worth a look.
