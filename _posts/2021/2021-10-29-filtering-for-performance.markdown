[Active countermeasures posted a nice writeup](https://www.activecountermeasures.com/filtering-out-high-volume-traffic/) regarding optimization of the packet capturing process and how filtering out trafic helps to keep up with high colume traffic.

This is connected with a nice three part series regarding improving packet capture performance ([part1](https://www.activecountermeasures.com/improving-packet-capture-performance-1-of-3/), [part2](https://www.activecountermeasures.com/improving-packet-capture-performance-2-of-3/), [part3](https://www.activecountermeasures.com/improving-packet-capture-performance-3-of-3/)).

It also includes references to some interreting tools like [pcap-stat](https://github.com/activecm/pcap-stats/) and previous write-ups regarding [hunting for false positives](https://www.activecountermeasures.com/threat-hunting-false-positives/).
