[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) is a map of the world, created by the community which is free to use and under open license.

I learned that it is the 17th birthay of the [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM) project this month and I found a nice [site with some information on how to contribute](https://opensource.com/article/21/8/openstreetmap) including applications for using OSM like [GNOME maps](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Maps).
