I was listening to the [Test and Code](https://testandcode.com) podcast and picked up something that I already pretty much have adopted though not as clearly presented. There were 4 questions which can be asked in relation to any project:

1. What is it that needs to be done?
2. What do we need in order to do it?
3. Where can we get what we need?
4. How can we tell if weâ€™re doing it right?

There was a bonus question which #1 could be substituted for:

   1. What's the most important thing that it doesn't do yet?

This is along the lines of the "[The 5 Whys](https://online.visual-paradigm.com/knowledge/root-cause-analysis/root-cause-analysis-5-whys-technique/)" which is a sort of root cause analysis technique which I've found useful from time to time.
