I head about updates to the [DHield API](https://isc.sans.edu/api/) last week. Not knowing what this was, though it sounded interresting, I found the associate website and [about us](https://www.dshield.org/about.html) content.

> DShield collects data about malicious activity from across the Internet. This data is cataloged and summarized and can be used to discover trends in activity, confirm widespread attacks, or assist in preparing better firewall rules.

At some point, figuring out how to perform API calls may be interresting for rules and filtering.
