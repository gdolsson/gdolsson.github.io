From an article by [bleeping computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/researchers-compile-list-of-vulnerabilities-abused-by-ransomware-gangs/) comes a nice compilation of attack methods used to gain initial access by different ransomware actors. The list was compiled by different contributers on twitter.

As well as providing a nice link to CERT NS where a roadmap of sorts outlining the ransomware process is available.
