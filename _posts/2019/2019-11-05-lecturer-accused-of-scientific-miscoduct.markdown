Today several local news outlets published articles regarding a lecturer/researcher/associate professor (depending on the source and potential translation issues) at the [Linnaeus University](lnu.se) being accused of scientific misconduct. According the online articles below, it was the [Swedish Research Council](https://www.vr.se) that raised the issue while processing an application for funding where a portion of the application text apparently showed a concerning degree of similarity with other sources.

It seems (or I would guess based on the content of the articles) that the cause was likely stress, potential communication problems and/or a versioning mistake during the finalisation and submission process of the application. Regardless, it is not fun when things like this happens, neither for the individual, the university of the research community in general.

It remains to be seen if the accusation becomes substantialised or dismissed and in case of the prior, what this would mean for the affected applicant with regards to consequences.
