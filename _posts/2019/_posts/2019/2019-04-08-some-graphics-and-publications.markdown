So congratulations are in order to my coworkers as they had a paper accepted in [Organic Letters](https://pubs.acs.org/journal/orlef7), regarding [Electrooxidative Amination of sp<sup>2</sup> C-H bonds: Coupling of Amines with Aryl Amides via Copper Catalysis](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.9b00003). Through a joint effort we also managed to get some sort of cover graphic associated with this publication, don't know where in the journal this graphic would be presented though it is [available on the website](https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/orlef7/2019/orlef7.2019.21.issue-7/orlef7.2019.21.issue-7/20190405/orlef7.2019.21.issue-7.largecover-2.jpg?radn=405289385171290)

[Organic Letters, April 5, 2019, Volume 21, Issue 7, Pages 1943-2492](https://pubs.acs.org/toc/orlef7/current)  
You can [access the cover graphics here](https://pubs.acs.org/appl/literatum/publisher/achs/journals/content/orlef7/2019/orlef7.2019.21.issue-7/orlef7.2019.21.issue-7/20190405/orlef7.2019.21.issue-7.largecover-2.jpg?radn=368288169607605) though no high resolution image was made available.

So, this is not something that I regularly consider however there has been a few covers and why not showcase them here?
