After some serious consideration I have finally decided to register a Twitter account for work related updates.

It turns out that a part of the consideration regarding the impact of a published paper is the visibility of that paper. I did put [my publication list](https://gdolsson.github.io/publications/) on this site to have them publicly visible and in that process I learned about [ALtmetric](https://www.altmetric.com/). It turns out that this tool is regularly used by grand/funding agencies internally at the university and apparently externally as well so it seems more important than I wanted to admit to be present in social media outlets outside of [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/).

Hence, there is now a link to [my very inactive Twitter account](https://twitter.com/GustafOlsson3) available and I will make an effort to update this with new or upcoming projects, events, publications and so forth.
