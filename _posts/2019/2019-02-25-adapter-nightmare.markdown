While I like to have a thin and light laptop, it does produce some issues. One such issue is only having 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports, which cannot be "split" into Thunderbolt 3 ports, only to USB-C ports and for which not all adapters have "power-through", meaning that if you plug one adapter into one port, it has to be able to pass power through the adapter in a separate port if you need more then one connection at once.

So this is the setup I'm looking at right now:

This mess is needed to use an external screen connected through miniDP with USB ports and adjustable brightness settings, power the laptop and using ethernet. It's not pretty but at least it is working.
