So there is really not that much to update on at the moment. Having enjoyed a total of two weeks vacation during July I have been working on three active projects. All are progressing fairly well though it can be somewhat frustrating to almost always try to use something to do something it was never designed to do ;-)

Today I just updated some things and thought I'd add a post just so as not to forget how to do it.
