Today we were visited by Thomas from [Malvern Panalytical]([Malvern Panalytical][0659bded]) who introduced us to out new instrument, the Zetasizer Nano ZS.

  [0659bded]: https://www.malvernpanalytical.com "Malvern Panalytica"

It is a dynamics light scattering (DLS) and Electrophoretic light scattering (ELS) instrument that can be used for both particle and molecular size determination as well as performing zeta potential measurements. After a nice technical introduction we got hands on experience using the instrument and accompanying software so now it is time to put this piece of equipment to good use.
