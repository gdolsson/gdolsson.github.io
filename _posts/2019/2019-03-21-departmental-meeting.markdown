This meeting offered a brief introduction to the people at the Grants and Innovations Office (GIO) and the services they can offer with regards to information on different funding agencies, grants and applications, support in application writing, feedback, immaterial property rights, legal support, start-up meetings for EU projects, project implementation, support in project auditing and evaluations and more.

There was also some information regarding a PhD course to be held this fall, "Innovative Applications of Research and Science", which sounds interesting on paper, however as I am not a PhD any more. probably not for me.

Strategic funds were discussed and it seems like there could be some interesting and rewarding ways these funds could be invested in the pedagogical development of our courses particularly with respect to distance courses.

There were also some minor discussions regarding the strategic documents of the university, in particular "Vision for LNU 2020-2030" which will be the topic of conversation during the next departmental meeting.

Other topics touched upon, senior-student mentorship programme that is being evaluated and has had some positive results. The need for an automated system to monitor non-active/non-participating students in courses, saving/withdrawing vacation days..
