Today I stumbled across a fantastic fact site while doing some research regarding my current inability to finish the current task at hand without getting sidetracked. I suppose that by writing this I am delaying the inevitable even further though this way I can still tell myself that I am doing something productive and not just getting distracted.

The site I found is part of the [Cal Poly](calpoly.edu) website, found under the [Academic Skills Center](https://asc.calpoly.edu/) where there is a whole page dedicated to [procastination](https://asc.calpoly.edu/ssl/procrastination). I encourage you to read it as it is both entertaining and leads to a bit of self reflection, not considering the scientific accuracy of any claims made, of course.
