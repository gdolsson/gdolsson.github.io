These are my notes, thoughts and interpretations regarding the seminar. As such there is room for misunderstanding, misinterpretation and more.

The title of this Fridays seminar was [_Synechococcus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synechococcus) in costal waters and odyssey of colours by the presenter [Hanna Farnelid](https://lnu.se/personal/hanna.farnelid/). It revolves around a mostly ignored but highly abundant organism globally and in particular in the baltic sea. You can read more about her research project here [Picocyanobacteria, significant primary producers but largely overlooked players in coastal waters](https://lnu.se/en/research/searchresearch/forskningsprojekt/project-picocyanobacteria/)

Hanna presented her work with [phytoplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton), in particular photosynthetic [picoplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picoplankton), 0.2-2 micrometer cells capable of photosynthesis. This includes both [_Prochlorococcus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prochlorococcus) and _Synechococcus_ where the prior is more abundant though has a narrower global distribution while _Synechococcus_ has a wider geographic distribution though are more scares. Even if these are both more or less common, they are both abundant in water samples, regularly as many as 10 000 _Synechococcus_ cells per cubic centimetre water and even up to 30 000 on warm summers.

These [autotrophic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autotroph) organisms are now being counted in environmental samples using [flow cytometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_cytometry) which allows for high throughput cell counting. Using this method one can distinguish between different species of phytoplankton based properties such as size and fluorescent properties. The availability of this method is aparently sething which has ben a driving factor in studies of picoplanktons. Their occurrence in the baltic sea is if interest as these small cells have previously been missed based on the limitations on analytical methods when measuring [chlorophyll a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll_a) producing organisms. The lack of studies has led to a lot of assumptions regarding these organisms. Investigating these assumptions and elucidating properties of these organisms is interesting as they are highly diverse. There are many gradients in seawater, in the baltic sea as well, gradients causing shifts in the ecotype of these organisms. These gradients include, salinity, nutrients and temperature, areas which have not been well investigated.

When starting at the university Hanna established a new costal sampling station "K-station" at Kalmar "kallbadhus", visited every Tuesday weekly. During these samplings the group have observed large shifts in abundance during sampling from week to week. Thanks to the saline gradients we have in the baltic sea, different populations of cyanobacteria can be observed. With Kalmar apparently being right "in the middle" in the range of high and low saline gradients we get many different strains.

A large physiological diversity can be observed in _Synechococcus_ strains, one such property are the observed large variations in accessory pigments. This has been relatively recently acknowledged as there are diverse _Synechococcus_ clades that often co-exists. Separating these has shown that organisms in the same clades can have different properties including metabolic preferences. These organisms also have vast arrays of colours thanks to their light harvesting pigments. These pigments are composed of variations of the base pigment [Phycocyanin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phycocyanin) and variations in [phycoerythrin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phycoerythrin) content and composition.

A method called [metagenomoics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagenomics) can be used to investigate the geographic occurrence of the pigment variations where different environments promotes different strains. Other metods used in relation to these studies are, [amplicon sequencing](https://en.novogene.com/next-generation-sequencing-services/microbial-genome/amplicon-sequencing/), [genome sequencing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whole_genome_sequencing) and metagenome sequence studies.

The data produced through ongoing research at the university is used to link organism types to geographic locations, characterising different [ecotypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecotype) observed based different temperatures, available [macronutrients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_macronutrients) and iron content. Properties that acts "selectors" for different ecotypes. These organisms are also interesting enough micro-chameleons and can undergo chromatic acclimation depending on what light they are exposed to, changing its entire morphology based on what pigment it expresses.

In the future, research by the group will involve identifying key ecotypes in the baltic sea, single cell analyses to identify within genus heterogeneity, interactions with other organisms and raise general awareness regarding these organisms.

In line with the latter, a nice source of additional information is available at [Phytopia](https://pace.oceansciences.org/phytopia).
