So this week has been quite a week. I finally got yet another draft finalised for at paper that has been in the workings for more than 2 years at this point. What started as a minor sidetrack ended up growing beyond being publishable as a single paper. Hopefully we can get this paper submitted within the next two weeks and Hopefully also get it accepted.

Meanwhile, tomorrow I have a class in the Higher Education Teacher Training course series I am attending. Tomorrow we are to present and motivate our ideas for a "didactical development pilot project". I'm almost there, let's just hope that I have not managed to misinterpret the purpose of this exercise.

Finally, tomorrow is Friday and that means seminars. We have two seminars coming up, [Silk-assembly enables integration of viable cells into engineered tissue](https://medarbetare.lnu.se/social/groups/aktuellt-vid-fakulteten-for-halso-och-livsvetenskap/posts/80065) presented in the KoB Research Seminar series by [Ulirka Johansson](https://lnu.se/personal/ulrika.h.johansson/) at 14:30-15:30 and [The social organisation and ageing of African mole-rats](https://medarbetare.lnu.se/social/groups/aktuellt-vid-fakulteten-for-halso-och-livsvetenskap/posts/79960) presented in the FHL Seminar series by [Markus Zöttl](https://lnu.se/personal/markus.zottl/) at 13:00-13:35. Check out the links for details regarding each seminar.

Unfortunately I will not be able to attend either as I will be visiting our other campus in Växjö.
