I spent Wednesday afternoon at [Hotel Skansen](https://www.hotelskansen.com/en/) in [Färjestaden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%A4rjestaden) on [Öland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96land) attending the "Advanced Materials Workshop". The website describing the [knowledge environment](https://lnu.se/mot-linneuniversitetet/kunskapsmiljoer/) (only in Swedish so far) which I am a part of named [advanced materials](https://lnu.se/mot-linneuniversitetet/kunskapsmiljoer/avancerade-material/) (also only in Swedish) is available through the [Linnaeus University](lnu.se) website.

The afternoon consisted of research presentations from collaborators within this knowledge environment to gain insights into what others are working with, what resources are available and where collaborations and projects can be initiated and formed.

First out, a presentation from the group working with [condensed matter physics](https://lnu.se/en/research/searchresearch/condensed-matter-physics/). This presentation included work on spintronics and semiconductors to develop smaller and more effective electronics (mainly storage and processing units). Topological [Dirac Materials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_matter) focusing on graphene, [topological insulators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_insulator) and topological semimetals ([Weyl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_semimetal) and Dirac). Additionally, molecular electronics in molecular semiconductors using primarily magnetic molecules. This in the search for molecules of interest in development of [qubits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit). The research group is mainly working with theoretical methods at the moment (density functional and *ab-initio* calculations).

Second out was the [Forest Products Group](https://lnu.se/en/research/searchresearch/group-of-forest-products/) from the Växjö campus. This seems to be a rather unique group in Swedish higher education focusing on all levels of research regarding a wide range of wood product related issues. They have many ongoing projects, with several involving private companies. One example is an industrial PhD in collaboration with IKEA and the [Swedish Research Counsel](http://www.kks.se/om-oss/in-english/) developing new adhesives, trying to replace or reduce the use of formaldehyde based adhesives and surface treatments with biorenewable alternatives. Another example was the [Formas](https://www.formas.se/en/start-page.html) project on thermo-reversible starch adhesives. This project was  based on previous work presented as "From native wheat starch towards innovative adhesives for wood panels". Using biomass and waste materials for bio-adhesives, the partial [liquefaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquefaction) and its potential in bio-adhesives. A side project working on renewable substances to improve water related properties of wood-based panels. New aspects on the strength behaviour of thermally modified timber, developing methods to predict properties of treated and untreated timber. Renewable biomass and waste materials for construction composites. Finally, bio-based polyurethane adhesives for cross-laminated wood panels.

The third presentation was from the [mechanical engineering](https://lnu.se/en/research/searchresearch/mechanical-engineering/) department, talking primarily about their work with welding and metallurgy. Describing computational processes, previous processes and projects they have been advising or working directly on including offshore rigs, the Wendelstein 7-X, a "fusion reactor with a twist". This group has an interesting approach to collaboration, any company who reaches out (regardless of financing opportunities) will receive collaboration/help/counselling as long as it is possible. A second member of the mechanical engineering department, though  from the group of applied mechanics (I cannot find a website for this group or the last one (the name of which I cannot remember)) working with robotics and surveillance of production systems. They are working with material mechanics of biological tissues, polymers, metals and bio-composites. Seemingly they are working with materials modelling an a more macroscopic scale. Examples presented included studies involving aneurysms, shear stress relaxation in actin networks (muscles), fraction mechanics of rubber, constitutive modelling of semi-crystalline polymers. Probabilistic and micromechanical modelling of cleavage fracture in ferric steel and simulations involving welding processes.

The fourth and fifth presentations, the [Bioorganic and Biophysical Chemistry Laboratory](https://lnu.se/en/research/searchresearch/bioorganic-and-biophysical-chemistry-laboratory/) presented details regarding the work in our group. Polymer science, molecular imprinting, synthetic receptors, detection, filtration and quantification systems. I will write up something regarding the work in our group at some point so this will be the shortest presentation. One presentation section described a project involving PKU - phenylketonuria ("mad Irish disease") and biomimetic polymers, in collaboration with [MipSalus](http://www.mipsalus.dk/). With a prominent researcher from this group adding to this with a presentation on sustainable synthesis of nanomaterials from renewable resources. Implementing green chemistry in materials production from bio-renewable sources using starting materials such as [zein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zein), [casein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casein), [chitin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chitin), [natural gums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_gum) and more in the production of nanomaterials. Working with mostly bottom up methods involving self-assembled scaffolds and [supramolecular chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supramolecular_chemistry). Materials are produced using template directed synthesis (primer materials or sacrificial scaffolds) with hard and soft templates. Hard templates are different oxides, polymers or mesoporous compounds where polymeric materials are grown around or inside a scaffold which is then removed/degraded forming microporous materials, nanowires or nanoparticles. Further, creating zein-based nanostructures by tuning the polymerisation conditions (solvent mixtures, pH and more) to create different formats including nanowires, nanoparticles, nanoporous materials and more. Apparently, a group of compounds called "phenolic acids" are the next interesting compound for biopolymers as only ethanol and water is needed as solvents and different formats can be obtained by tuning the solvent mixture.

The last presenter before I had to run out was from the [The Molecular motor and bionano-group](https://lnu.se/en/research/searchresearch/the-molecular-motor-and-bionano-group/) presenting details regarding their work with biomaterials, mostly in the form of muscle fibres and molecular motors ([actin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin) and [myosin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myosin)). This was very interesting though I'll have to refer to the website for details on ongoing projects as I did not manage to take comprehensive notes during this presentation.

As I taught a class during the second day of the workshop at the university, I was not able to attend the second half of this lunch-to-lunch workshop.
