Today is Friday and post have not been regular as I have been busy lately. Yesterday we hosted a meeting for the EU funded project (MindGAP) that I am currently working on here in Kalmar.

We now have some online presences that was revealed, however the website is apparently to be moved and updated in a short period of time.

It was an interesting meeting and it was very nice to finally meet the other collaborators on this project.

Today is Friday which means seminars, we will be hearing about "[First step to establishing the Ottenby Center for Bird-borne Infections](https://medarbetare.lnu.se/social/groups/aktuellt-vid-fakulteten-for-halso-och-livsvetenskap/posts/88228/post_files/34477)" presented by [Neus Latorre Magalef](https://lnu.se/personal/neus.latorre/) and the one year seminar of [CÃ©line Steib](https://lnu.se/personal/celine.steib/).

Hope to update with something interresting in a not to distant future.
