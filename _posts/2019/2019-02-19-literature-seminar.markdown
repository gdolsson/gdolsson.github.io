Today we were visited by our new collaborators at [Luma Metall](https://luma-metall.com/) who also participated in our group meeting. Scheduled for today were two literature seminars, one to be presented by me. The topic for my presentation was "molecular solar thermal energy storage systems".

I read a few papers last week though this one caught my eye since I have coworkers experienced in working with both [Suzuki reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suzuki_reaction) as well as extensive experience with [Diels-Alder reactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diels%E2%80%93Alder_reaction), two methods used to produce the molecular isomer-couple used for energy storage. The paper discussed during the seminar was the following:

**Macroscopic heat release in a molecular solar thermal energy storage system**  
Wang Z, Roffey A, Losantos R, Lennartson A, Jevric M, Petersen AU, Quant M, Dreos A, Wen X, Sampedro D, BÃ¶rjesson K  and Moth-Poulsen K. _Energy Environ. Sci._ (2019),**12**,187. DOI:[10.1039/C8EE01011K](dx.doi.org/10.1039/C8EE01011K)

A well written paper I can recommend to anyone interested.
