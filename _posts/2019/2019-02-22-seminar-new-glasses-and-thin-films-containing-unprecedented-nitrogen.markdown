Today we have a public seminar by Associate Professor [Sharafat Ali](https://lnu.se/personal/sharafat.ali/) who will be talking about his work on nitrogen rich oxynitride glasses and thin films as hard, durable and strong material. Their preparation using different techniques and variations of properties as well as new amorphous thin films will be discussed.
