So, after struggling to get started I did manage to write up a new draft for my latest paper. After some feedback it was then completely re-written into another paper, a slight annoyance though cooler head prevailed and the hopefully this draft will soon be submitted for publication.

This is a project I have been working on for almost two years, not the only project and not continuously though still a lot of time has been invested. It has been drafted and re-drafted, different methods investigated, replicate studies performed and finally it seems like we're on the home stretch to get this paper publish. An early version of a presentation showcasing the method was presented at a conference the summer 2018 during "[The 10th International Conference on Molecular Imprinting](https://www.ortra.com/events/mip2018/Home.aspx)" and was titled [Computational prediction of template discrimination properties in molecularly imprinted polymers](https://events.eventact.com/ProgramView2/Agenda/Lecture?id=178088&code=3468634). After a lot more work this has finally taken the form of a project to be published, though from past experience we are now likely 2-4 version away from submission and 1-2 submissions followed by one revision round away from seeing this paper published.

In the meanwhile, I started working on the next paper. During a spurt this summer/fall I produced a massive amount of data running numerous simulations of different systems and now I have to finalise these projects and write up papers for publication. Now, I realise that this might not be the the most common view on publications though I really dislike writing them. I enjoy the buildup, doing the experiments, reading the papers, running the simulations, gathering the results and summarising them creating nice graphic presentations and so forth. Though when it comes to writing and publishing a paper, I regularly wish I had an assistant that could do this for me.

So it is the middle of the week, as usual there will be seminars on Friday and I'll update the site accordingly. Meanwhile, fingers crossed that I manage to actually write the bulk of the second paper so it can become a finalised draft soon.
