Time flies, always. Turns out that yesterday was July first and as usual there is still a ton of work and little time to get it done.

I am now looking forward to some time of work and spending a few days with the family, spending some quality time with them and possibly going on some little trip somewhere.

It seems like a long time however these next six weeks will fly by and then the next semester starts, new students, new courses, new projects and new challenges.

Currently I am gearing up for a new project as I will be making a slight career adjustment and initiate a new long term collaboration. At the same time trying to finish up with some old lingering publications that needs to be finalised and also, trying to design a didactical development project to finish an interesting course I initiated last fall.

Now to stop avoiding to finish the tasks initiated yesterday. Turns out that I was not incompetent, it was just the software I was using at the computational centre we are using that had not been updated since early 2009. That was a morning well spent, so with the technical difficulties out of the way it is time to get rid of some imaginary frequencies.
