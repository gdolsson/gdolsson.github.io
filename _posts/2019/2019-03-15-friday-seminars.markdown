This has been a quiet week as I have been home due to illness. Well, today is Friday and I managed to get one day of work in before the weekend.

As it is Friday, this is also seminar-day here at the Linnaeus University. Today at 13:00 Prof. [Per Larsson](https://lnu.se/personal/per.larsson/) is presenting a talk on [European catfish in Möckeln, Småland](https://medarbetare.lnu.se/social/groups/aktuellt-vid-fakulteten-for-halso-och-livsvetenskap/posts/80643). Apparently, the European catfish is one of the largest freshwater fishes in the world and lives in lakes in Småland. The seminar will deal with details about their ecology.

At 14:30, assistant professor [Thomas Näsström](https://lnu.se/personal/thomas.nasstrom/) is finally delivering his talk [Towards understanding amyloid formation in Lewy body disease – importance for therapeutic intervention](https://medarbetare.lnu.se/social/groups/aktuellt-vid-fakulteten-for-halso-och-livsvetenskap/posts/80640) which has been posted just to be canceled numerous times before. The pathological mechanisms behind Parkinson’s disease and Dementia with Lewy bodies still remains unknown and Thomas is working to characterise central amino acid segments in amyloid forming proteins, for their propensity to initiate neurodegenerative disease.

Details regarding these seminars, location, availability options and more can be found using the links above.
