This Thursday (yesterday) was departmental meeting day. Following are my notes and my own interpretation of the material delivered. This, of course, means that I might have misinterpreted or misunderstood things. A couple of different topics were touched upon during the meeting. The economy of the university is strained and we need to conserve resources. There are new wage policies and criteria available. There were some notices regarding the follow-up of the performed safety inspections, we need to continue to label chemicals and storage lockers/containers properly. We also need to keep safety precautions available, not blocking emergency equipment or exits. Finally, there was a walkthrough of the results from this falls work environment survey.

In short, there was [a letter/note](https://medarbetare.lnu.se/social/groups/linneuniversitetets-nyhetsbrev/posts/91722) published on the university staff page from the vice-chancellor of the university commenting on the state of the economy. While money is tight and we need to conserve resources, cut back on expenses and preferably increase income, the general message was that there is a plan and no one should feel alarmed.

Some of the presented points so far to keep in mind regarding the financial situation were the following:

KOB (the development of chemistry and biomedicine) are currently having negative numbers with regards to education (balance in research). Suggestions on how to improve on the financial status of the department (and university as a whole) were:
- Reduce costs for external staff
  - Using cheeper alternatives and minimising use of external resources
- Make sure our own staff has full duty
  - Optimise the usage of existing staff
- Minimise "loans" of "research staff"
  - Using researchers for teaching is expensive
- Increase student numbers
  - New/improved educational programs
  - Increase student uptake and retention

Not clearly outspoken though it is clear that recruitments will not be a priority.

Information regarding the revised wage policy and criteria was available on the university staff page "[medarbetare](https://medarbetare.lnu.se/)"

Three points from the revised documents concerning staff appraisals were:
- Shown ability to retrieve good results with high quality
- Shown ability to cooperate and contribute to a good work environment
- Shown ability to contribute to development of the organisation and activity

Additional wage criteria is also available for:
- Teachers and researchers: teaching skills, scientific skills
- Technical/administrative (separate document)
- Managers

Information regarding this and the referenced documents are available on "medarbetare" (only in Swedish right now):

Finally, the results from the work environment survey that was conducted during the fall was presented. The results were seemingly OK, most people are not discontent with their jobs, the leadership or the working environment in general. Sadly, a majority of the staff was not really super excited or happy either. This do raise some interesting questions, is the working environment a larger issue or are many people not working with what they would have wanted? This discussion is however outside the scope of this short update. Needless to say, there is a need to improve the working environment though as the results show, there are no major acute problems, which is positive. What I found one thing amusing, most seemed to perceive the staff appraisal process as unsatisfactory and non-productive. This was highlighted by the administration as surprising as this process takes a lot of time and has an important purpose. However, as there is no room for adjustments of salaries (likely perceived as the main purpose of these "pre-salery-negotiation-talks", poorly translated from Swedish) in the university budget, the need to set aside 30 min for this talk and the time for processing and delivering the outcome of these talks can obviously be perceived as unnecessary.

The results from the work environment survey that was performed during the fall of 2019 is available on "medarbetare".
