[Lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com/netflix-has-secret-codes-1848812894) had an article outlining the "secret" [netflix-codes](https://www.netflix-codes.com/) you can use to access categories of content on netflix without searching or recommendations. It is a long list.

Only works in the browser, just stick it at the end of the adress as such:

https://netflix.com/browse/genre/xx

Where "xx" should be replaced by any code from the [netflix-codes](https://www.netflix-codes.com/) site.
