[Chainsaw](https://github.com/countercept/chainsaw) was authored by Hames D, lead threat hunter at F-Secure's Countercept division. It is designed to assist in first-response activity of security engagements and assist blue teams triage entries relevant for investigation.[[1](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-chainsaw-tool-helps-ir-teams-analyze-windows-event-logs/)-[2](https://labs.withsecure.com/tools/chainsaw/)]

Chainsaw lets you
- Search through event logs by event ID, keyword or regex patterns
- Extract and parse Windows Defender, F-Secure, Sophos and Kaspersky AV alerts
- Detect key event logs being cleared or log service being stopped
- Detect users being created or added to sensitive user groups
- Brute-force of local user accounts
- RDP logins, network logins etc.

Sigma rule detection also works for numerous Windows event IDs, including

|Event Type|Event ID|
|:-|:-|
|Process Creation (Sysmon)|1|
|Network Connections (Sysmon)|3|
|Image Loads (Sysmon)|7|
|File Creation (Sysmon)|11|
|Registry Events (Sysmon)|13|
|Powershell Script Blocks|4104|
|Process Creation|4688|
|Scheduled Task Creation|4698|
|Service Creation|7045|

It is an open source tool using [EVTX parser library](https://github.com/omerbenamram/evtx) with several available output formats. EVTX is another excellent project, an open source software, cross-platform parser for WIndows XML EventLog format. Written in rust, fast and multi threaded with conversion to different output formats such as json and csv format.
