A nice writeup regarding "Hunting for Persistence in Linux". Presented as part one in a series:

[Hunting for Persistence in Linux (Part 1): Auditd, Sysmon, Osquery (and Webshells)](https://www.activecountermeasures.com/hunting-for-persistence-in-linux-part-1-auditd-sysmon-osquery-and-webshells/)

From this initial part, [auditd](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/configure-linux-auditing-auditd) for linux (CentOS/RHEL) seems of particular interest and should be something to look  at. As well as [sysmon](https://github.com/Sysinternals/SysmonForLinux) for linux.
