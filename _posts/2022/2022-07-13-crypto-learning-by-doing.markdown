Cryptography is one of those things that you must know and use though for which the details are most often blurry and complicated.

This week, two sources presented nice DIY explanations for different cryptographic methods, Henry Schmale put up a post "[Interactive Encryption and Decryption using RSA](https://www.henryschmale.org/2022/03/14/rsa.html)" which lets ju follow along the steps involved in RSA encryption.

A few days later, Francis Stokes added an article called ["Rolling your own crypto: Everything you need to build AES from scratch (and then never use it for anything of consequence)"](https://github.com/francisrstokes/githublog/blob/main/2022/6/15/rolling-your-own-crypto-aes.md). Pretty self-explanatory, and a really nice write-up where you can follow along and lear how NOT to do it yourself.
