A while ago, apple announced their "rights to repair" compromise, the [self service repair](https://support.apple.com/self-service-repair) program. Allowing users to repair their own devices, access to manuals, [order original Apple parts](https://selfservicerepair.com/) etc. Even recycling of used parts.

A nice initiative and hopefully something which stays online and available.
