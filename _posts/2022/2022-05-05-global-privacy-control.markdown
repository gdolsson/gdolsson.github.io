[Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org), a browser based signal (GPC) which states you privacy preferences to all sites visited. Sites can (should) respect preference sent and act accordingly.

Supported by numerous browser extensions for different browsers, [OptMewout](https://www.privacytechlab.org/optmeowt/) is an [opens source](https://github.com/privacy-tech-lab/gpc-optmeowt) plugin which seems quite nice and works with both chrome and firefox.

> OptMeowt sends Do Not Sell signals to every website you choose to easily opt you out of data selling and tracking. All you need to do is install, and we take care of the work to handle these requests for you.

> OptMeowt does not collect any data or information itself. It is 100% open source and non-commercial.
