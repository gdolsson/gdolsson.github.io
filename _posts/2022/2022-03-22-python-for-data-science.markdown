Got three nice resources in an email today, do check these out and work through the exercises. This will give some real, hads-on experience.

[Python for Data Science](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-for-data-science/) by Geeks for Geeks, real nice resource for all things data science with python.

[Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) by O'Reilly in full for free (as in beer) as Jupyter notebooks.

[Solving real world data science tasks with Python Pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMOA1pPVUc4) is a nice video introduction by Keith Galli over at YouTube.

Other nice videos from the same guy include [Complete Python Pandas Data Science Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmEHCJofslg) (start with that one maybe) and two videos on MatPlotLib ([video1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAQNHzOcO5A&t=0s) and [video2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0P7QnIQDBJY&t=0s))
