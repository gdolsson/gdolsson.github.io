[ZMap](https://github.com/zmap/zmap) is a network scanner designed for internet wide scans and part of the [The ZMap Project](https://zmap.io/), provided by the [Stanford Security Research](http://esrg.stanford.edu/) group ([GitHub](https://github.com/stanford-esrg))

The ZMap project provides numerous free and open source tools for network scanning and intelligence gathering.

Tools provided include
[ZMap](https://github.com/zmap/zmap)

Trying to run zmap following [the directions](https://github.com/zmap/zmap/wiki) fails on macOS as additional configuration is needed, you must manually set the MAC address of the gateway as ZMap operates on L3:

```
$ arp -a
```
Will get you the MAC address of your gateway on correct interphase, then:
```
$ zmap -p <port> -o <output.csv> -G <MAC address> -i <interphase>
# example
zmap -p 80 -o output.csv -G 00:00:00:00:00:00 -i en0
```
Will get you going.
