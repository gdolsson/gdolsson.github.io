Looking around for things "PostgreSQL" I stumbled upon [CrunchyData](https://www.crunchydata.com/). Now I was not really interested with the database-as-a-service part, though what I did find was a nice, in-browser playground where you can learn about PostgreSQL and interact with databases right in the browser.

Check out the [Postgres Tutorials](https://www.crunchydata.com/developers/tutorials) available.
