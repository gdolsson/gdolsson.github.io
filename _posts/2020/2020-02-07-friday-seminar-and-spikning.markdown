To events worth noting today, [Anu Helin](https://lnu.se/en/staff/anu.helin/) "nailed" her thesis titled "Eco-immunological studies of innate immunity in Mallards (_Anas platyrhynchos_)". Anu will defend the thesis on [February 28th](https://lnu.se/en/meet-linnaeus-university/current/events/2020/public-defence-in-ecology-anu-helin/) in the field of Ecology.

There is also a Friday seminar, [Thomas Näsström](https://lnu.se/personal/thomas.nasstrom/) will present ["Aggregation of engineered peptides of the α-Synuclein NAC 71-82 segment yields different fibrillar species"](https://medarbetare.lnu.se/social/groups/aktuellt-vid-fakulteten-for-halso-och-livsvetenskap/posts/94581/post_files/36097) today at 14:30 in "Azur" (room Vi2166).

Updates regarding the seminar might be added later.

Turns out that there were actually two seminars, [Baswanth Oruganti](https://lnu.se/en/staff/baswanth.oruganti/) presented ["Excited-State Aromaticity – A Powerful Tool in Photochemical Design"](https://medarbetare.lnu.se/social/groups/aktuellt-vid-fakulteten-for-halso-och-livsvetenskap/posts/94524/post_files/36085) at 13:00 in "Azur" (room Vi2166). The printed schedule for FHL and KOB seminars are not available yet and the online updates have not been as timely as one would have hoped.
