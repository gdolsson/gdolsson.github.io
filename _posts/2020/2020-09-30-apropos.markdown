Figure there is a command to do something on the CLI, forgotten that thing you used that time? Try `apropos`.

```bash
apropos(1)                                                                                                                                                                   apropos(1)

NAME
       apropos - search the whatis database for strings

SYNOPSIS
       apropos keyword ...

DESCRIPTION
       apropos searches a set of database files containing short descriptions of system commands for keywords and displays the result on the standard output.

AUTHOR
       John  W.  Eaton  was  the  original  author  of man.  Zeyd M. Ben-Halim released man 1.2, and Andries Brouwer followed up with versions 1.3 thru 1.5p.  Federico Lucifredi <flu-
       cifredi@acm.org> is the current maintainer.

SEE ALSO
       whatis(1), man(1).
```

So when you figure the command you are looking for might have something to do with say `ssh` then

```bash
$ apropos ssh
ssh(1)                   - OpenSSH SSH client (remote login program)
ssh-add(1)               - adds private key identities to the authentication agent
...
...
ssh-keygen(1)            - authentication key generation, management and conversion
ssh-keyscan(1)           - gather SSH public keys
ssh_config(5)            - OpenSSH SSH client configuration files
```

You can then use the suggestion from above "`whatis`":

```bash
$ whatis ssh
ssh(1)                   - OpenSSH SSH client (remote login program)
...
sshd_config(5)           - OpenSSH SSH daemon configuration file
```

To narrow in on the topic of you interest and finally "`man`" to get the real lo-down:

```bash
$ man ssh
SSH(1)                    BSD General Commands Manual                   SSH(1)

         [-i identity_file] [-J destination] [-L address] [-l login_name] [-m mac_spec] [-O ctl_cmd] [-o option] [-p port] [-Q query_option] [-R address] [-S ctl_path] [-W host:port]

AUTHORS
     OpenSSH is a derivative of the original and free ssh 1.2.12 release by Tatu Ylonen.  Aaron Campbell, Bob Beck, Markus Friedl, Niels Provos, Theo de Raadt and Dug Song removed
     many bugs, re-added newer features and created OpenSSH.  Markus Friedl contributed the support for SSH protocol versions 1.5 and 2.0.

Pretty neat for those of us with low performance memory.
