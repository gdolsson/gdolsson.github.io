It seems that this is just another version of the Jupyter notebook \(or any other online collaboration notebook version\) The [introduction is available here](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) and the adress even ends in ipynb which I would guess is ipython notebook file, in other words Jupyter (currently).

Just thought I'd make a note of this as it might become useful or relevant in the future at some point.
