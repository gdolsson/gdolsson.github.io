The [research paper](https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1275) presenting novel data regarding the possibility of reinfection from SARS-CoV-2 went live and it seems that it is not all doom and gloom. As the reinfected individual was seemingly asymptotic after having been hospitalised during the first infection, this can be indicative of a lasting defence against the virus.

What this would mean is that even if there are no permanent circulating antibodies prepared to catch the virus upon reinfection, there are mechanisms dealing with the virus upon reinfection, making the effects less detrimental.  There are still a number of unknowns regarding reinfection. This is an isolated case, there is little information regarding potential changes to the virus which might also be a cause for the difference in severity of infection and so forth. Though at this point, it seems likely that one can catch this virus more than once. It seems like a possible reinfection will likely be less severe thanks to some mechanism of the immune system and this also does indicate that we will be stuck with SARS-CoV-2 as a recirculating virus.
