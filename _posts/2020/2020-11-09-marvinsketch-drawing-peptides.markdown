Generating 2D peptide representations is a hassle if trying to draw these "by hand". It is slightly less painstaking if using template AA to put together to a peptide, though there [had to be a better way](http://infochim.u-strasbg.fr/webserv/marvin/help/formats/seq-doc.html)

First, use the `Edit` menu and find `Source`

Using the link provided above ([or here](http://infochim.u-strasbg.fr/webserv/marvin/help/formats/seq-doc.html)) to check that you are entering the AA sequence in an appropriate manner

|Ala|Arg|Asn|Asp|Asx|Cys|Gln|Glu|Glx|Gly|His|Ile|Leu|Lys|Met|Phe|Pro|Pyl|Sec|Ser|Thr|Try|Tyr|Val|Xaa|Xle|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|A|R|N|D|B|C|Q|E|Z|G|H|I|L|K|M|F|P|O|U|S|T|W|Y|V|X|J|

This will likely produce a completely garbage overlaid pile of letters on screen (at least for me). You can right-click this pile and use the `Expand Groups` option to show the actual structure. You can shift 1/3 letter abbreviations displayed. There is also an option to `ungroup`. I am uncertain what effect this has and why it would be reasonable to do it, still.
