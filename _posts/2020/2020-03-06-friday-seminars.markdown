This Friday there were two seminars, a pre-dissertation seminar by [Dick Sjöström](https://lnu.se/personal/dick.sjostrom/) presenting his work with protein engineering. A really nice presentation regarding designing proteins using a combination of computational and experimental methods. At some point there will likely be some information available at [http://protein.technology/](http://protein.technology/).

The other seminar, "[Water and Waste Management on High Altitude – How to reach the top when you are over 67?](https://lnu.se/mot-linneuniversitetet/aktuellt/kalender/2020/water-and-waste-management-on-high-altitude--how-to-reach-the-top-when-you-are-over-67/)” by
[William Hogland](https://lnu.se/personal/william.hogland/) was a presentation regarding several excursions to high altitude areas, discussing wast management and availability to fresh drinking water water remediation in these locations and the associated challenges.
