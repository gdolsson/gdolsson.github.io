Just stumbled upon a nice [flowchart](https://f.hubspotusercontent00.net/hubfs/4627953/graphpad-flowchart-pdf.pdf?hsCtaTracking=5e442466-a43d-4ee2-a1d1-c9b886fa8448%7Cddae23b1-1b86-423f-9c3a-6623bd74b2b8) from the "[prism](https://www.graphpad.com/scientific-software/prism/)" people which can help you select an appropriate statistical method.

Thought I'd put it here for future reference.
