It is getting hard to keep track of that light at the end of the tunnel. It seems that most people in Sweden not thinks the pandemic is over as out government has lifted all restrictions regarding national and international travel for all age groups and stopped having their regular briefings on the situation. In the region where I live it seems like we will be having a large influx of tourists and summer residents in about 2-4 weeks and it is expected that we will be experiencing an increase in infection by the middle of July to August.

Meanwhile, according to some inline sources regarding the current status of infection in Sweden, we aren't doing that great.

Seeing as how we are not really at peak infection, lifting all restrictions right before major vacation period seems somewhat counter intuitive to me at least.

Still, there are some small encouraging news, there is a vaccine soon to enter phase III trials and I thought I'd put [the link here](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/science/coronavirus-vaccine-tracker.html?utm_source=Nature+Briefing&utm_campaign=0abe317800-briefing-dy-20200611&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_c9dfd39373-0abe317800-45429866) so I don't loose it.
