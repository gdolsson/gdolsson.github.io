title: Second reinfection?

As reported by (amongst others) [ARS technica](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/08/another-covid-19-reinfection-this-time-second-infection-was-more-severe/) there has been reports of a second person getting reinfected. This time a 25 year old from Nevada, infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus for a second time about 48 days after a first infection. This is less than two months which adds some grim indications regarding immunity. What is even worse is that the second infection was worse than the first one, requiring hospitalisation and oxygen support. Hence, even if you catch COVID-19 and get better, a second infection can still snuff you out or at least put you in the hospital. This is not good news at all, though it should still be noted that the findings by researchers at the [University of Nevada](https://www.unr.edu/) which were [published online](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3681489) is still a preprint and has not been peer reviewed.
