Watching a documentary, I heard something really interesting presented by a [Yukiyasu Kamitani](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/Yukiyasu-Kamitani-38461616) ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=m5wNiJ4AAAAJ&hl=en)) who works with neuroscience. What was discussed was using MRI measurements while showing images to a subject, registering the response. Then using machine learning algorithms to recreate the images based on MRI data. As interesting and impressive as this was to hear, the implication presented was even more interesting. Getting this technology right could mean that we would be able to record dreams. As images are produced in the brain played out in our dreams, these could be rendered outside of the dream-state by machine learning only from registered data from brain activity.

I found two mentions of this, a [Nature News item](https://www.nature.com/news/scientists-read-dreams-1.11625) and the associated [research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627308009586?via%3Dihub).

Even if this is not something that will likely be realised any time soon, this is really interesting and a real piece of science-fiction.
