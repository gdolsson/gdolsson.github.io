After being home taking care of a sick family for a few days I am currently back at the office. Though for how long, well that remains to be seen.

I did find some positive information that I might want to find again and if someone else finds it, might help put a little light in the end of a now dark tunnel.

Meanwhile, [wash your hands regularly](https://www.cdc.gov/handwashing/when-how-handwashing.html), stay home if you are sick, use common sense, avoid crowds (social distancing) and stop hoarding surgical gloves and masks as well as toilet paper.
