These are strange times. While hearing from friends and colleagues being home quarantined in different countries over the world, things in Sweden still seems somewhat like "business as usual". Although I suspect that this is also depending on where you live.

Having heard different estimates over the past six months it seems that the generally accepted "best case scenario" for Sweden, with the approach we've taken, should result in a minimum of 30 000 people dead from COVID-19. As our numbers still are below [4000 deaths as of today](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/09f821667ce64bf7be6f9f87457ed9aa) and the expected peak infection date for our region is predicted as May 25th, this seems low.

Regarding work, it seems that different universities are dealing very differently with this crisis. Some have ordered all non-essential staff to work from home while others are carrying on as usual. Well, with online teaching and minimal student presence.

Personally, I have been working from home going on my third week. Mostly focusing on molecular dynamics simulations at the moment, I am able to do a lot of my work from home with little disruption to the regular routine. I am only working part-time, spending some quality time with my children.

So, the updates have suffered a lot lately,  what have I been missing?

Among other things
[FHR-4 and complement activation in human AMD retinas](https://medarbetare.lnu.se/social/groups/aktuellt-vid-fakulteten-for-halso-och-livsvetenskap/posts/99132), [another link](https://lnu.se/mot-linneuniversitetet/aktuellt/kalender/2020/fhr-4-and-complement-activation-in-human-amd-retinas/)

[FHL Seminar 24/4: Chemistry didactics – From theory to practice](https://medarbetare.lnu.se/social/groups/aktuellt-vid-fakulteten-for-halso-och-livsvetenskap/posts/98635), with a video link provided here: [Video Link](https://play.lnu.se/media/t/0_1kowhkux). The [KOB Research Seminar 24/4 via ZOOM: "Selective targeting of cancer cells with PARP-1 inhibitors from Myristica fragrans \(Houtt.\)](https://medarbetare.lnu.se/social/groups/aktuellt-vid-fakulteten-for-halso-och-livsvetenskap/posts/98575)

Now this past Friday there were two seminars scheduled, the
[FHL Seminar 15/5: "Viruses – more than SARS-CoV-2"](https://medarbetare.lnu.se/social/groups/aktuellt-vid-fakulteten-for-halso-och-livsvetenskap/posts/99590). Provided is a [link which is sadly likely not working as of writing this](https://play.lnu.se/media/t/0_1kowhkux) as this seminar was canceled. And finally, there was the [Reduce, Reuse and Recycle, the 3Rs of Sustainable Development – Synthetic Polymer and Electronic Waste Perspectives](https://medarbetare.lnu.se/social/groups/aktuellt-vid-fakulteten-for-halso-och-livsvetenskap/posts/99492), which was also canceled. There were apparently some technical issues with service where these videos are supposed to be published and I a not sure both seminars were actually held.

I'm hoping that the ZOOM hosted presentation will also become watchable from [LNU play](https://play.lnu.se) at which time I will update the links.

Of course there are lots of more things I am missing and things that are not "normal" though I think this is enough of an update for now.
