There is currently a contagion moving across the globe. In all fairness there are a ton of them though at this point in time, one is receiving a lot more attention than the others. This is of course the "corona virus" or "Wuhan virus", more appropriately named 2019-nCov. The spread of this virus has caused problems outside of the actual health issues. There are fake vaccine providers popping up online (if you are asked to pay for a vaccine using bitcoin, this is most likely not a real service today. Especially as there is no vaccine yet) There has been phishing campaigns targeting peoples worries regarding this outbreak. Unverified sources and social media are adding to a growing sense of panic and it is more important than ever to use a critical approach when ingesting news regarding this virus.

I will not provide many facts at this time though I will supply some links to interesting resources were you can find reliable information for yourself.

There is an interactive map being maintained from the John Hopkins University [showing the spread](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) of the virus globally. Another good source of information is the John Hopkins University Hub  posting [Novel Coronavirus information](https://hub.jhu.edu/novel-coronavirus-information/).

The World Health Organization has a [similar page available](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019)

Another resource is the  European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control
European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control which also provides information regarding the [Geographical distribution of 2019-nCov cases globally](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases)

The general advice is to get inoculated agains the seasonal influenza, you will help minimise the workload on hospitals treating influenza patients and avoid problems determining if it is seasonal influenza or 2019-nCov.
