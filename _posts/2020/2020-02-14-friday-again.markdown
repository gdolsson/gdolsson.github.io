As I was on vacation last Friday, spending some time with the "family unit", I was unable to attend last weeks Friday seminars. However, the FHL seminar was [Markus Franz√©n](https://lnu.se/personal/markus.franzen/) presenting ["The effect of land use and extreme weather on butterfly and moth populations"](https://medarbetare.lnu.se/social/groups/aktuellt-vid-fakulteten-for-halso-och-livsvetenskap/posts/94839/post_files/36210) at 13:00 in "Azur" (room Vi2166).

The KOB seminar was [Erik Lindahl](https://lnu.se/personal/erik.lindahl/) who presented his one year seminar at 14:30 in "Azur" (room Vi2166).
