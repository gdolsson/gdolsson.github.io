Sometimes the smallest things are extremely hard. Like, sharing a 800 Mb EndNote package file with hundreds upon hundreds of PDFs.

How do you remove all the PDFs in an endnote library from within EndNote? You don't... So how do you do it if you really need to?

Open you library, save a Compressed Library (.enlx) file. In the pop-up, select "Without File Attachments" and hit OK.

The compressed .enlx file can now be opened again with EndNote, not containing any PDFs and you can save your library with any name you want.
