Today [Clara Vidal Carulla](https://lnu.se/personal/clara.vidalcarulla/) defended her thesis titled [Children's emergent chemistry in the preschool](https://lnu.se/en/meet-linnaeus-university/current/events/public-defence-in-natural-sciences-didactics-clara-vidal-carulla/). The defence was excellent. Nice presentations from both opponent and defendant, the following discussion and questioning by the examination board was thorough and thoughtful, both enjoyable and informative.

Hopefully I will find a copy of the thesis in my mailbox, otherwise I'll make sure to request one.
