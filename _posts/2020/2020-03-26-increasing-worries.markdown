Well, at some point in time it was pretty much expected that things would stat to get tense and it seems that time is now.

Having spent a week taking care of myself and my family at home I came back to work realising that the building was somewhat emptier. Many have opted to use their vacation, are sick and/or are working from home to avoid people.

For the most part it seems that many are still carrying on "business as usual", though I have noticed a decrease in available slot-times for food pickup and deliveries by the local grocery store/supermarket. It seems that "social distancing" is slowly catching on, though I suppose more could be done. International collaborators seem furious regarding the relaxed attitude that seem to be adopted in Sweden and there is a completely different level of "panic".

Now, today I will attend the first to virtual "university wide" gatherings for some information regarding the future image and vision of the university and a dept. meeting. I suppose we'll see how that will work out today.

In the meanwhile, I did come across this video by a "poster/channel" that I really enjoy on youtube "Kurzgesagt â€“ In a Nutshell", where you can find a lot of interesting and high quality informative videos to enjoy. This one is regarding the [corona virus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BtN-goy9VOY), which I've learned is now called SARS-CoV-2 and the disease you get from this virus is called COVID-19.

Some rather interesting facts that I've that I hear on two different podcasts, [Stuff You SHould Know](https://podcasts.nu/avsnitt/stuff-you-should-know/how-covid-19-works) and [This Week in Science](https://www.twis.org/18-april-2020-episode-765-who-has-the-mars-maps/) presenting data in the viability of the "corona virus". Apparently the virus can survive in/on [fomites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomite) for different periods of times. In air, as an aerosol formed from sneezing/coughing the virus can remain viable for 3 hours, 4 hours on copper surfaces, 24 hours on cardboard 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel. While the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-nCoV/index.html) still claims that there has been no documented infections from fomites, which is really ensuring, it still means that it is possible. The latter being somewhat scary. So, if you just leave your mail untouched over night you should be good. The only fact that had me worried was the 3 hour aerosol thing, as it is quite possible that you might end up in the vicinity of someone who has coughed and at some point in time. Though logically I think that the aerosolised virus will fall to the ground inside of three hours meaning you wont breath in the virus particles by passing through an area were someone coughed 2 hours ago.

I suppose that remain calm, wash hands, avoid people and do not do anything stupid is still the best advice.
