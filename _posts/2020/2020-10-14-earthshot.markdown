Today I heard about [The Earthshot Price](https://earthshotprize.org/) for the first time. On a yearly basis it is supposed to provide funding for five "Earthshots" (as inspired by the concept of moonshot), ideas to solve the worlds greatest environmental problems which if achieved by 2030 will improve life on earth.

The Earthshot Prize is centred around five ‘Earthshots’ – simple but ambitious goals for our planet which, if achieved by 2030, will improve life for us all, for generations to come.

I really liked this initiative and hope that it will inspire the development and produce a encourage a drive to find solutions to make the world a better place for all its inhabitants.
